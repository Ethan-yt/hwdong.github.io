Here is a [simple tool](http://hwdong.com/VF/VFtool.7z) to design vector field.Just move the mouse to a position (don't click) and press key such as 0 or  1 or 2 or 3 or 4 to design different design elements  and finally press â€˜F3' key to update the vector field .  You should remove the added postfix to make the program become an exe file.
