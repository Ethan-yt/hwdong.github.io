I wrote simple code for designing vector field and the resulted vector field from three design elements is :

Here is my [simple tool](http://hwdong.com/VF/VFtool.7z) to design vector field.Just move the mouse to a position (don't click the mouse) and press a digital key such as 0 or  1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 0 to determine the type of the design element. You can do this several times to generate several different design elements  and finally press ‘F3' key to update the vector field .  You can also smooth the vector field by draging a curve with the mouse left button pressed followed by press ‘F2' key,read readme.txt for more details.

Before run the program VFdesign.exe,you should first modify the filename "VFdesign.exe=postfix" to "VFdesign.exe".
