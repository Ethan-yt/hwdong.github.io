This morning I spend a few hours to implemented the algorithm in the paper "[Color Map Optimization for 3D Reconstruction with Consumer Depth Cameras](http://vladlen.info/publications/color-map-optimization-for-3d-reconstruction-with-consumer-depth-cameras/)" .

It is very simple to implememt. The author din't provide the raw data for test, I will test it a few days later when we capture some high quality test data.  The result of the paper is like this:
