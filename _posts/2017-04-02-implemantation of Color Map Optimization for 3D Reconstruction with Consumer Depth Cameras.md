This morning I spend a few hours to implement the algorithm in the paper "[Color Map Optimization for 3D Reconstruction with Consumer Depth Cameras](http://vladlen.info/publications/color-map-optimization-for-3d-reconstruction-with-consumer-depth-cameras/)" . 
<!--more-->

It is very simple to implememt. The author din't provide the raw data for test, I will test it a few days later when we captured some high quality test data.  The result of the paper looks like this:

You can download my program from [here](http://hwdong.com/programs/Color_Optimization.exe). But you must email me so that I can tell you how to run this program. If someone need this in your code,you can ask me to send you an API library.
